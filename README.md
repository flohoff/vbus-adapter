This repository contains a Vissmann VBUS Adapter KiCad 9 Project.

It uses a Wemos S2 Mini as the ESP32 Interface and offers a
CAN Bus for e.g. Vissmann Vitocal and a VBUS Interface for
connecting to a Vitrotrans a relabeled Resol.

It allows for connecting additional Sensors like DHT22 or DS1820

Currently the project is untested.
